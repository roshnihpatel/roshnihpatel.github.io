Data-driven approaches are well integrated into livestock farming, and machine learning algorithms are increasingly used to maximise productivity, cost efficiency, sustainability, and animal welfare. With the global demand for animal products expected to double by 2050, the livestock industry is turning to AI to optimise operations and boost production. However, while AI promises improvements in efficiency and disease prevention, its implications for animal welfare are often overlooked. Despite promising advancements in AI ethics, research and conversations around AI often neglect non-human entities, despite the significant scale of anthropogenic animal suffering.

## Current Applications of AI

AI is being increasingly integrated into livestock farming practices, often in conjunction with existing technologies like Precision Livestock Farming (PLF). PLF utilises a range of sensors—such as smart ear tags, activity collars, cameras, microphones, and temperature loggers—that collect data on animals' health and behaviour. This data is then analysed using AI and machine learning algorithms, either to inform farmers or to automatically adjust conditions for the animals.

For example, Sainsbury's, a major UK supermarket, uses AI to monitor cows for early signs of illness, track improvements in behaviour, and suggest ways to increase comfort levels. In China, AI and PLF systems monitor individual chickens via chips attached to their legs, acting as pedometers to detect early signs of disease by identifying inactive birds. Surveillance sensors continuously monitor intrusions by wild dogs or breaches in fencing in real-time. These technologies aim to prevent disease outbreaks, increase animal comfort, and protect animals from wild predators.

Beyond PLF, AI is also being deployed in novel ways across various sectors of animal farming. In aquaculture, a Canadian start-up, Wittaya Aqua, uses predictive models to forecast animal growth and recommend optimal feed types and quantities, boosting yield. In Scotland, computer vision technology employing lasers and cameras detects and identifies phytoplankton species, alerting fish farmers to potential harmful algal blooms that could threaten fish health and cause environmental issues when present in large numbers. Humans consuming shellfish that have absorbed these toxic phytoplankton can become ill, and blooms can also be fatal to farmed fish. Vertical Oceans has developed fully automated indoor shrimp farms that don’t use chemicals, hormones, or antibiotics and don’t contribute to ocean pollution. These technologies offer significant benefits, including early illness detection, disease prevention, improved biosecurity, products that are safer for human consumption, better environmental outcomes, and enhanced production efficiency.

## Risks of AI in Livestock Practices

AI-enabled systems could perpetuate or even exacerbate some of the most harmful practices in industrial farming by making them more efficient and widespread. The expansion of human control over animals through AI could entrench intensive farming methods that prioritise productivity over animal welfare.

Technical failures present another significant concern. AI systems rely on sensors and other hardware that are often vulnerable to the harsh conditions of farms, such as high dust or ammonia levels. Failures in these systems—whether due to power cuts, software bugs, hardware malfunctions, or sensor obstructions—can lead to missed or inaccurate alerts, allowing animal illnesses to go undetected until it’s too late. In extreme cases, technical malfunctions could cause catastrophic events, such as barn fires, especially in highly automated farms that lack adequate backup plans.

Wearable sensors, although designed to monitor animal health, can also cause direct harm by creating discomfort or lesions. Furthermore, animals may find it stressful to adapt to automated systems like robotic milking or feeding machines. Another critical issue is that the metrics prioritised by PLF systems—such as growth rates or milk yield—do not necessarily align with what is most meaningful for animal welfare. For instance, using AI to facilitate practices like night-time lighting in chicken barns to boost productivity can be detrimental to the animals’ natural behaviours and well-being.

## Reducing Risks

The design of AI systems should prioritise minimal invasiveness, such as using the smallest possible number of multi-purpose sensors that are comfortable for the animals. Sensors should be designed with minimal size, weight, and noise production, and should be thoroughly tested in a range of conditions before widespread deployment.

Fairness and accuracy in AI algorithms are also crucial. Algorithms trained on biased or incomplete data may reinforce existing issues, so there should be strict guidelines for quality validation and performance testing of AI systems. Additionally, AI interventions should be transparently reported to farmers, including the conditions under which they have and have not been validated.

The current emphasis on production efficiency and competitiveness often drives the adoption of AI technologies that prioritise output over welfare. By expanding the criteria for what constitutes successful AI interventions to include animal welfare metrics, the industry can help shift the balance towards a more ethical use of technology.

## Governance in AI-Driven Livestock Farming

While AI has the potential to reduce suffering through early disease detection and better environmental management, it also risks entrenching harmful industrial farming practices. It is important that AI's use in livestock is governed by comprehensive policies that ensure ethical standards and animal welfare are at the forefront. By establishing clear regulations and governance, we can enable the livestock industry to leverage AI in ways that contribute to a more compassionate and sustainable future for animals.
