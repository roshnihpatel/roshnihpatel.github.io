## The Current Food Crisis
The United Nations has set a target to end hunger by 2030, but progress has been slow. Although regions like Latin America and the Caribbean have seen some positive trends, with hunger rates declining over the past two years—resulting in 4.3 million fewer people facing hunger—progress has stagnated globally. In 2023, 9.1% of the global population—around 733 million people—still faced hunger, with numbers remaining largely unchanged for three consecutive years.

Food insecurity is defined as the lack of regular access to enough safe and nutritious food for an active and healthy life. At moderate or severe levels, food insecurity still affects 28.9% of the world's population, equating to 2.33 billion people. Among them, 864 million face severe food insecurity, posing serious threats to their health and well-being.

It is estimated that by 2030, 582 million people will suffer from chronic undernourishment, with a significant majority in Africa.

The world produces more than enough food to feed everyone. However, inefficiencies in the food system—such as waste, spoilage, and losses due to pests and pathogens—result in the loss of 1.3 billion tons of food each year, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).

Emerging technologies, including AI interventions, have the potential to address inefficiencies in the food supply chain and improve the global state of hunger.

## AI Innovations Tackling Food Insecurity

FarmView, an AI-driven initiative, uses robots and drones to collect data on sorghum growth, analysing how a plant’s genetics and environment impact its development. This information enables the creation of new sorghum varieties that are high-yielding, high-protein, and resilient to drought and heat—traits essential for cultivation in famine-prone regions with harsh climates.

The use of AI-driven drones and ground sensors (phenotyping) allows for the rapid identification of the most resilient crop varieties, making breeding efforts more precise and significantly faster.

Beyond crops, AI is also tackling other climate-related challenges. In Bangladesh, AI-powered spatial surge forecasting is being used to predict tidal surges in vulnerable coastal regions. This technology provides localised predictions that help communities take proactive measures to protect their crops from flooding and other climate shocks, thus reducing potential losses.

AI is transforming humanitarian aid with tools like Optimus, developed by the World Food Programme. This decision support system uses data-driven algorithms to optimise the delivery of aid, ensuring that resources are allocated in the most efficient and cost-effective manner. Optimus has also been employed in Bangladesh to evaluate food baskets and cash transfers, leading to adjustments that better meet the nutritional needs of refugees.

Similarly, the HungerMap LIVE platform leverages big data and predictive analytics to track and forecast food security in near real-time. By combining data from diverse sources—such as weather, population size, conflict, and economic indicators—HungerMap LIVE can forecast food security trends up to a month in advance, equipping humanitarian organisations with the information they need to respond proactively to emerging crises.

Food insecurity is a multifaceted crisis, driven by conflict, climate change, economic instability, and deep-rooted inequalities that limit access to nutritious food. As these drivers become more frequent and intense, often occurring simultaneously, they are compounded by underlying issues such as poverty, lack of education, and poor food environments.

The projections indicating the number of individuals who will be undernourished by 2030 are 130 million higher than those made before COVID-19, reflecting the compounded effects of the global pandemic and the fragility of global food systems.


## AI's Future in Food Security

Addressing world hunger requires more than simply increasing food production. AI can be a valuable tool not just within agriculture but across the broader ecosystem of factors that influence food security. For instance, AI-driven climate models can help predict and mitigate the impact of extreme weather events on food supplies, and AI tools can contribute to the prevention of pandemics by identifying potential outbreaks before they spread.

While AI alone cannot solve world hunger, it can play a crucial role in complementing broader efforts to achieve global food security. To maximise its impact, it's essential that AI solutions are made accessible and equitable, particularly for the poorest and most marginalised communities who are most affected by food insecurity.
