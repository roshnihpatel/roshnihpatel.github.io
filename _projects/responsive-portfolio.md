This project is a responsive portfolio website where I showcase some of my past projects, built with a mobile-first approach. The design prioritizes mobile users, progressively enhancing the layout and features for larger screens through media queries. This approach helped me gain a solid understanding of responsive layouts and CSS best practices.
