This project was a solution to a personal challenge I faced while learning Spanish. I found sound associated mnemonics helpful for memorising spanish words, but creating the mnemonics was time consuming. I decided to fine-tune a Language Model to automatically generate sound association mnemonics from English words and their Spanish translations

For example, the Spanish word for "dawn" is amanecer. A sound-based mnemonic would be: "At dawn, the man is here (amanecer) to greet the sun." The phrase "man is here" phonetically resembles amanecer while the imagery is linked to the wordâ€™s meaning.

I used Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques and Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) to fine-tune a Small Language Model (Phi-2) to generate sound association mnemonics from English words and their Spanish translations.
