In this Python project, I've implemented a Tic-Tac-Toe game with a AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm. 

Minimax recursively explores every possible move for both players, and then selects the optimal move that either maximize the AIâ€™s chance of winning or minimize its chance of losing. 

You can find the project [here](https://github.com/roshnihpatel/minimax-tic-tac-toe)
